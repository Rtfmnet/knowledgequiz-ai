<question id="q001" type="single-choice" domain="Sprint Planning" complexity="advanced">
<text>Your team is halfway through Sprint Planning when they discover that a key dependency service will be unavailable during the Sprint due to scheduled maintenance. The Product Owner insists on maintaining the Sprint Goal. What should the Scrum Master facilitate?</text>
<options>
<option id="a" correct="false">Recommend the team commit to the original Sprint Goal and work around the dependency during the Sprint</option>
<option id="b" correct="true">Guide a discussion to redefine the Sprint Goal or adjust the Sprint Backlog to work without the dependency</option>
<option id="c" correct="false">Escalate to management to postpone the maintenance window</option>
<option id="d" correct="false">Split the team to work on alternative backlog items while waiting for the dependency</option>
</options>
<explanation>Sprint Planning should result in a realistic Sprint Goal and backlog. When dependencies threaten achievability, the team should adapt the goal or backlog rather than commit to unrealistic objectives. This maintains empirical process control and sustainable pace.</explanation>
</question>

<question id="q002" type="multiple-choice" domain="Product Backlog Management" complexity="advanced">
<text>During backlog refinement, stakeholders request detailed estimates for items planned 6 months ahead. Which approaches best balance stakeholder needs with agile principles?</text>
<options>
<option id="a" correct="true">Provide high-level sizing using t-shirt sizes or story point ranges</option>
<option id="b" correct="false">Create detailed estimates for all items to satisfy stakeholder requirements</option>
<option id="c" correct="true">Focus refinement efforts on items likely to be developed in upcoming Sprints</option>
<option id="d" correct="true">Educate stakeholders on the cone of uncertainty and estimation accuracy over time</option>
<option id="e" correct="false">Assign the Product Owner to provide all long-term estimates independently</option>
</options>
<explanation>Agile estimation recognizes that accuracy decreases with distance from development. High-level sizing, focusing on near-term items, and stakeholder education about uncertainty maintain agility while providing useful planning information.</explanation>
</question>

<question id="q003" type="single-choice" domain="Impediment Management" complexity="advanced">
<text>A critical team member consistently dominates Daily Scrums, preventing others from contributing meaningfully. After addressing this privately with no improvement, what is the most effective next step for the Scrum Master?</text>
<options>
<option id="a" correct="false">Remove the team member from Daily Scrums temporarily</option>
<option id="b" correct="true">Introduce structured facilitation techniques like round-robin or timeboxing individual updates</option>
<option id="c" correct="false">Ask the Product Owner to address the behavior in the next Sprint Review</option>
<option id="d" correct="false">Schedule separate one-on-one check-ins with other team members</option>
</options>

</question>

<question id="q014" type="single-choice" domain="Impediment Management" complexity="advanced">
<text>Your team identifies a systemic organizational impediment that requires C-level executive attention to resolve. The impediment significantly impacts multiple teams&apos; effectiveness. What is the Scrum Master&apos;s most appropriate action?</text>
<options>
<option id="a" correct="false">Document the impediment and wait for it to surface in higher-level organizational reviews</option>
<option id="b" correct="true">Escalate through appropriate organizational channels while providing data on the impediment&apos;s impact</option>
<option id="c" correct="false">Work with other Scrum Masters to develop a team-level workaround solution</option>
<option id="d" correct="false">Advise teams to adapt their processes to work around the organizational impediment</option>
</options>
<explanation>Systemic impediments require escalation with supporting data to demonstrate impact. The Scrum Master serves the organization by making these impediments visible and facilitating their resolution, rather than allowing teams to suffer with workarounds.</explanation>
</question>

<question id="q015" type="multiple-choice" domain="Cross-functional Collaboration" complexity="advanced">
<text>Your Development Team lacks certain specialized skills needed for upcoming Product Backlog items. Which approaches best maintain team self-organization while addressing skill gaps?</text>
<options>
<option id="a" correct="true">Arrange knowledge transfer sessions with internal experts or external consultants</option>
<option id="b" correct="false">Add specialists to the team permanently for each required skill</option>
<option id="c" correct="true">Pair team members with experts during actual development work</option>
<option id="d" correct="true">Invest Sprint time in learning and experimenting with new technologies</option>

</question>

<question id="q016" type="single-choice" domain="Continuous Improvement" complexity="expert">
<text>After implementing several process improvements from retrospectives, your team&apos;s velocity has increased but stakeholder satisfaction has decreased. What does this indicate about the team&apos;s improvement focus?</text>
<options>
<option id="a" correct="false">The team is gaming velocity metrics and should return to previous practices</option>
<option id="b" correct="true">Process improvements may be optimizing internal efficiency without considering external value delivery</option>
<option id="c" correct="false">Stakeholder expectations need to be reset to align with the team&apos;s improved capabilities</option>
<option id="d" correct="false">Velocity increases naturally create temporary stakeholder adjustment periods</option>
</options>
<explanation>This scenario suggests the team may be optimizing internal metrics (velocity) without considering external outcomes (stakeholder value). Effective improvement requires balancing internal process efficiency with external value delivery and stakeholder satisfaction.</explanation>
